# 09 DevOps

## Acronym
* DevOps - Development and Operations 

## Intro
* DevOps (Development and Operations) brings together people, processes,
  and technology, automating software delivery to provide continuous value
  to your users. Azure DevOps Services allows you to create build and release
  pipelines that provide continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for
  your applications. You can integrate repositories and application tests,
  perform application monitoring, and work with build artifacts. You can also
  work with and backlog items for tracking, automate infrastructure deployment
  and integrate a range of third-party tools and services such as Jenkins and
  Chef. All of these functions and many more are closely integrated with Azure
  to allow for consistent, repeatable deployments for your applications to
  provide streamlined build and release processes.
