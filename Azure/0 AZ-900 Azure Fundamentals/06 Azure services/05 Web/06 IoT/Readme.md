## Acronym
* IoT - Internet of Things

## Intro
* People are able to access more information than ever before. It began with personal
  digital assistants (PDAs), then morphed into smartphones. Now there are smart watches,
  smart thermostats, even smart refrigerators. Personal computers used to be the norm.
  Now the internet allows any item that's online-capable to access valuable information.
  This ability for devices to garner and then relay information for data analysis is
  referred to as the Internet of Things (IoT).
