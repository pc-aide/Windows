# 07 Big Data

## Intro
* Data comes in all formats and sizes. When we talk about Big Data,
  we're referring to large volumes of data. Data from **weather** systems,
  **communications** systems, **genomic** research, imaging platforms, and many
  other scenarios generate hundreds of gigabytes of data. This amount of
  data makes it hard to analyze and make decisions. It's often so large
  that traditional forms of processing and analysis are no longer appropriate.

* Open source cluster technologies have been developed to deal with these large
  data sets. Microsoft Azure supports a broad range of technologies and services
  to provide big data and analytic solutions.
