## Acronym
* AI - Artificial Intelligence

## Intro
* Artificial Intelligence, in the context of cloud computing, is based around
  a broad range of services, the core of which is Machine Learning. Machine Learning
  is a data science technique that allows computers to use existing data to forecast
  future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. Using machine learning, computers learn without
  being explicitly programmed.

* Forecasts or predictions from machine learning can make apps and devices smarter.
  For example, when you shop online, machine learning helps recommend other products
  you might like based on what you've purchased. Or when your credit card is swiped,
  machine learning compares the transaction to a database of transactions and helps
  detect fraud. And when your robot vacuum cleaner vacuums a room, machine learning helps it decide whether the job is done.

| 01 | Machine Learning                             | Cloud-based environment you can use to develop, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models. It can auto-generate a model and auto-tune it for you. It will let you start training on your local machine, and then scale out to the cloud |
| 02 | Machine Learning Studio (classic) workspaces | Collaborative, drag-and-drop visual workspace where you can build, test, and deploy machine learning solutions using pre-built machine learning algorithms and data-handling modules                                                                         |
